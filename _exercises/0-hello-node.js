    Welcome to the node workshop.

    These exercises will help you getting comfortable with nodejs. First we will see a bit of nodejs native functionality
    then we'll move on to servers, api's, and some frameworks that are useful.

    To be installed:
    - NodeJS (www.nodejs.org) or "brew nodejs" for mac
    - MongoDB (www.mongodb.com) or "brew install mongodb" for mac

    Check if installations were successful by using the following commands:
    - node --version (needs to be 8+)
    - npm --version (needs to be 5+)
    - mongod (will start your mongodb instance)

    How to run files? Try by running this file
